Hi, I'm Cyril and this is my website! I may write about open data, programming, bioinformatics or various tech-related things.

I made this website to share thoughts, programming tips and projects I'm working on, and things I learn along the way.

### Technical notes about this website

This site is built with the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) static site generator with the [Abridge](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge/) theme and uses the dynamic DNS from [afraid.org Free DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/).
