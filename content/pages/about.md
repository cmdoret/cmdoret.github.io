I'm a computational biologist by training, located in Switzerland. During my PhD in the [Spatial Regulation of genomes](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/spatial-regulation-of-genomes/) laboratory, I found a special interest for implementing and promoting good practices in scientific research and software development.

This has lead me to the [Swiss Data Science Center](https://datascience.ch/), where I joined the Open Research Data team as a data science engineer. I now help life science and biomedical researchers and institutions improve their [FAIR data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) and software engineering practices.

In my spare time, I also like to tinker with open software and hardware. I may occasionally post about it in here.
